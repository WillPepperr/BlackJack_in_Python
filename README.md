# BlackJack_in_Python

A simulated Blackjack experience via the Python console. I created this because I had not seen any examples online of a program that accurately simulates blackjack as it is played in a real casino. 
<br><br/>

This means generating a randomly shuffled shoe and progressing through it until a limit is reached for the shoe to be shuffled. This allows for what is referred to as "Card Counting" or "Advantage Play". Included in the program is the card counting calculation (Both the "Running" and "True" counts). 
<br><br/>

The program allows for 1 initial hand to be played against the dealer, but the cases for playing multiple hands via splitting the hand are accounted for, accurately calculating winnings for each hand.
<br><br/>

Not included in this program are insurance bets and late surrendering. Insurance has select cases where it is beneficial for the player if they are counting cards properly, otherwise, it is usually a statistically losing bet. Late surrendering is an advantage to the player but is not a standard rule in casinos because it gives players slightly better odds of winning.

Here is a quick visual of the ruleset of the blackjack game created:
